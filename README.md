# Lune-Roblox-place-script-exporter
Single script to export all scripts from a roblox place file.

# How to use?
1) Clone this repo or just download "main.luau"
2) Put your place file in the same directory as the script.

- It can be either an .rbxl or .rbxm file.
3) Configure the input place file and output directory in the "main.luau" file
- I made the output directory automatically grab the name of the input place file, but you can change that
4) Do "lune run main.luau" in the directory with the script and wait for ~0.3 seconds
5) Profit
